The second week of GSoC involved getting the behavior trees integrated with the Oreons, thus the ability to run
different animation loops based on the scenario in the game.
## Deltas for Oreons
The basic prefab of an Oreon creature is defined in the [Oreons](https://github.com/Terasology/Oreons)
 modules.
This prefab declares the _'bare bones'_ features of an Oreon like its skeletal mesh,
its animation loops for standing, walking etc.
In order to add components to this prefab a delta<a href="#deltas"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
was added to MOO which declares the behavior tree to be used.
