Over the course of the past month I too jumped on the Machine Learning wagon and started getting familiar with the concept through various online sources. So, the one thing that I noticed was that while there are numerous sources to learn the basics and getting started with various
concepts in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in general, but all of them are spread out across various sites and sources, which prompted me to write this post as a one stop spot with all concepts that I have learnt so far.
### External Sources
I started with some MIT-OCW classes and the IntelStudentsKit to learn the basics. Here is a list of all the sources I used :  
	- *Intel Student Kits* listed [here](https://software.intel.com/en-us/ai-academy/students/kits) especially _Machine Learning 501_ and _Deep Learning 501_. These kits include study material and exercise "notebooks"<a href="#notebooks"><sup>[1]</sup></a> divided up into
             chunks of week long tasks which makes them convinient to follow.  
	- [6.034 Artificial Intelligence](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-034-artificial-intelligence-fall-2010/) from the MIT-OpenCourseWare catalogue. This Prof. Winston instructed course is great and piquing the interest of any student and 
	also helps in understanding some really complex topics like Support Vector Machines with ease.  
	- Besides the exercises in the Intel Student Kits I also reffered to some lessons and examples on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/machine-learning) too to get a broader prespective on how things are/should be done.  
	- And the holy grail of courses for machine learning beginners, [Machine Learning by Andrew Ng ](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) on Coursera.
