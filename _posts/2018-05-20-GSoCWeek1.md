The first week of GSoC was a smooth one, with just making some dependency<a href="#dependency"><sup>[1]</sup></a> changes for the [MasterOfOreon](https://github.com/Terasology/MasterOfOreon) module and getting the Oreons to spawn correctly in the world.
## Retiring the Miniion module
Currently the Miniion module is composed of a lot of deprecated code and recent changes to the engine have rendered it to an unusable state.
MasterOfOreon has(rather had) a dependency on the [Miniion](https://github.com/Terasology/Miniion) module for its Task Management System and
assigning AI behaviors to the minions spawned in the world. Removing Miniion dependency
was a straight-forward task which just involved deleting out the Miniion related code
and adding some comments for later refferal. The Task Management system will implemented
from scratch as a part of my project and as far the AI assignment to creatures is concerned
it is to be done using the the shiny new Behavior Trees<a href="#BTs"><sup>[2]</sup></a>.

## Spawning the Oreons
The feature to spawn creatures into a world was previously implemented in the
_[Spawning](https://github.com/Terasology/Spawning)_ module, as evident from the
fact that it is a fairly old module and it only supports spawning one type of creatures the Oreons buggy behavior from
it was expected. But it was cool to watch the Oreons come alive for the first time.
![spawning](/img/spawning.png)
The idea behind the Spawning module was to create a way to spawn a plethora of creatures
into the world hence the multiple Oreons and since they the Oreons do not have any behaviors
attached they just remain static at the location of spawn.
This is where my work began. I started by adding the Portal block to the module and then
attaching an interaction screen with it, which can be triggered using the `e` key when the
Portal is in your crosshair. The interaction screen displays the options for various Oreons
available and their item requirements for spawn. An initial implementation involved the
use of `Dirt` and `Sand` blocks, but this would replaced in the future with more "oreon-centric"
items.

So, using the minimalistic screen above a player can now spawn three types of Oreons given
that they have the required items in their inventory. The items required by the Oreon for
spawning are defined in their prefabs<a href="#prefabs"><sup>[3]</sup></a> in the OreonSpawn
component which would be attached to every spawned Oreon entity and consist of some basic
information about the Oreon like its owner that are required by the _Central Holding_ to keep track
of happenings in the village, but I am getting ahead of myself. More on this later!
