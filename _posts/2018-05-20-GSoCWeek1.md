The first week of GSoC was a smooth one, with just making some dependency<a href="#dependency"><sup>[1]</sup></a> changes for the [MasterOfOreon](https://github.com/Terasology/MasterOfOreon) module and getting the Oreons to spawn correctly in the world.
## Retiring the Miniion module
Currently the Miniion module is composed of a lot of deprecated code and recent changes to the engine have rendered it to an unusable state.
MasterOfOreon has(rather had) a dependency on the [Miniion](https://github.com/Terasology/Miniion) module for its Task Management System and
assigning AI behaviors to the minions spawned in the world. Removing Miniion dependency
was a straight-forward task which just involved deleting out the Miniion related code
and adding some comments for later refferal. The Task Management system will implemented
from scratch as a part of my project and as far the AI assignment to creatures is concerned
it is to be done using the the shiny new Behavior Trees<a href="#BTs"><sup>[2]</sup></a>.
