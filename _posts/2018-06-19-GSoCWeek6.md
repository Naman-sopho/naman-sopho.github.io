The week 6 of my work period involved a significant overhaul of the gameplay for the MasterOfOreon module. About a week ago, an Oreon would walk to an area assigned for the task and voil√† task compeleted, an event which was only manifested by the removal of the area rendering.
 Now, blocks are being placed into the world as an outcome of the tasks being completed.
