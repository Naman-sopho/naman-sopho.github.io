I am currently a Graduate student at Johns Hopkins University, pursuing a Masters in Computer Science. I completed my Bachelors of Technology in Electrical Engineering with a minor Computer Science and Engineering from IIT, Dhanbad in Jul, 2019.  

Coding has been more than just a hobby for a long time. I have been fond of programming ever since I knew what it meant. I continue to learn and build new stuff each day.  

I strongly believe in the FOSS philosophy and have been activel participating in various Open Source Projects. I am active contributor to the Open Source voxel based game [Terasology](https://terasology.org) developed under the org [
MovingBlocks](https://github.com/MovingBlocks). I completed my Google Summer Code 2018 [project](/2018-08-07-GSoCWrapUp/) with Terasology and will also be acting as a mentor with org for [Google Code-In 2018](https://http://codein.withgoogle.com/).

### Projects:
#### Judging a book by its cover
  - Accepted for publication at IEEE Region10 Symposium.
